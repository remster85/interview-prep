Hiii I need some help to design aggregates in a financing trading desk application. So we snapshot regularly the positions of the our trading book let's say every 10 minutes . What would be the aggregate model here ?

Let's assume we want to get the last snapshot of the day and keep the last snapshot of every day every day


ChatGPT said:
Hi Remi! Happy to help with your aggregate design. From what you described — regularly snapshotting positions for a trading book and needing to retain daily snapshots (latest of each day) — here's how you might model your aggregate(s).

📌 Domain Summary
You have:

A Trading Book or set of Trades.

Snapshots of positions taken every 10 minutes.

A requirement to:

Access the last snapshot of the day (latest by timestamp).

Store only the latest snapshot for each day, not all intraday snapshots.

✅ Aggregate Design Approach
🎯 Candidate Aggregate Root: PositionSnapshot
Each PositionSnapshot captures the state of the positions in a book at a specific time.

📦 PositionSnapshot Aggregate
text
Copy
Edit
PositionSnapshot (Aggregate Root)
├── snapshot_id: UUID
├── book_id: TradingBookId
├── snapshot_time: datetime
├── positions: List<Position> or Dict<InstrumentId, Position>
├── snapshot_date: date  <-- derived from snapshot_time.date()
Identity: snapshot_id (can be synthetic or a composite of book_id + snapshot_time).

Invariant to enforce: Only one snapshot per book per day should be stored as the latest.

🔁 How You Update
Every 10 minutes, a new PositionSnapshot is taken.

But before persisting, your domain service checks:

Does a snapshot already exist for this book_id and snapshot_date?

If no → Save it.

If yes and snapshot_time is more recent → Overwrite it.

You can make this rule part of a domain service, not the aggregate itself, to avoid loading large amounts of state into memory.

💡 Alternative Model with Aggregating Book History
You might also consider a higher-level aggregate:

📦 DailyBookPosition Aggregate
text
Copy
Edit
DailyBookPosition (Aggregate Root)
├── id: UUID or composite (book_id + date)
├── book_id: TradingBookId
├── date: date
├── latest_snapshot: PositionSnapshot
This is useful if you're going to access positions by day a lot and want to ensure exactly one snapshot per day per book.

🗃️ Persistence / Query Layer (CQRS Friendly)
If you follow CQRS:

Command side handles snapshot ingestion and enforces the “one per day” rule.

Query side indexes: book_id + snapshot_date -> latest snapshot

🔐 Invariants to Enforce
One snapshot per book per day.

Snapshots are immutable once stored (unless you're using overwrite logic for the latest only).

Snapshot date is derived from snapshot_time — consistency is key.

🧪 Example Usage
To get last snapshot of the day:

python
Copy
Edit
repo.get_by_book_and_date(book_id="EQ-US", date=date(2025, 7, 24))
🤔 Optional: Book as Aggregate Root?
If the TradingBook is an active entity and you want to encapsulate its behavior (e.g., managing open positions, trade application), it can also be modeled as an aggregate root. Then:

text
Copy
Edit
TradingBook (Aggregate Root)
├── book_id
├── positions: Dict<InstrumentId, Position>
├── apply_trade(trade)
├── snapshot() → PositionSnapshot
But for snapshotting purposes only, using PositionSnapshot or DailyBookPosition as aggregate roots is simpler and avoids loading the entire trading book unnecessarily.

Would you like me to sketch this in code? Or help you think through snapshot storage and cleanup over time?

How would it look like  in more details pls

TradingBook (Aggregate Root)
├── book_id
├── positions: Dict<InstrumentId, Position>
├── apply_trade(trade)
├── snapshot() → PositionSnap

Sure, let's dive deeper and flesh out the TradingBook aggregate, the Position, and the PositionSnapshot.

We'll treat TradingBook as a stateful aggregate root that:

Applies trades

Maintains current positions

Can produce a snapshot of those positions

🧱 Domain Model
🔷 TradingBook (Aggregate Root)
python
Copy
Edit
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict
from datetime import datetime
import uuid


@dataclass
class Position:
    instrument_id: str
    quantity: float
    average_price: float

    def apply_trade(self, quantity_delta: float, price: float):
        total_value = self.quantity * self.average_price + quantity_delta * price
        new_quantity = self.quantity + quantity_delta
        if new_quantity == 0:
            self.average_price = 0.0
        else:
            self.average_price = total_value / new_quantity
        self.quantity = new_quantity
python
Copy
Edit
@dataclass
class TradingBook:
    book_id: str
    positions: Dict[str, Position] = field(default_factory=dict)

    def apply_trade(self, instrument_id: str, quantity: float, price: float):
        if instrument_id not in self.positions:
            self.positions[instrument_id] = Position(instrument_id, 0, 0.0)
        self.positions[instrument_id].apply_trade(quantity, price)

    def snapshot(self) -> "PositionSnapshot":
        return PositionSnapshot.create(self.book_id, self.positions)
🔷 PositionSnapshot (Entity, also Aggregate Root if used independently)
python
Copy
Edit
@dataclass
class PositionSnapshot:
    snapshot_id: str
    book_id: str
    snapshot_time: datetime
    positions: Dict[str, Position]

    @staticmethod
    def create(book_id: str, positions: Dict[str, Position]) -> "PositionSnapshot":
        # Make a deep copy to ensure immutability of snapshot
        snapshot_positions = {
            instrument_id: Position(
                instrument_id=pos.instrument_id,
                quantity=pos.quantity,
                average_price=pos.average_price
            )
            for instrument_id, pos in positions.items()
        }
        return PositionSnapshot(
            snapshot_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            book_id=book_id,
            snapshot_time=datetime.utcnow(),
            positions=snapshot_positions
        )
🔄 Sample Usage Flow
Apply trades and generate snapshots
python
Copy
Edit
book = TradingBook(book_id="EQ-NY")

# Apply some trades
book.apply_trade("AAPL", 100, 180.0)
book.apply_trade("AAPL", -50, 182.0)
book.apply_trade("MSFT", 200, 310.0)

# Take a snapshot
snapshot = book.snapshot()
🗃️ Repository and Storage Responsibility
You would store the PositionSnapshot in a database with:

book_id

snapshot_time

And retain only the latest per day (could be enforced via:

upsert logic

unique constraint on book_id + snapshot_date

or application-level deduplication)

🔍 Query Scenarios
Latest snapshot for today:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM position_snapshots
WHERE book_id = 'EQ-NY'
  AND snapshot_time::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY snapshot_time DESC
LIMIT 1;
All end-of-day snapshots:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DISTINCT ON (book_id, snapshot_date) *
FROM position_snapshots
ORDER BY book_id, snapshot_date, snapshot_time DESC;
Or if you're using a separate DailySnapshot table, that logic would be in the write-side process to promote the most recent snapshot each day.

🛠️ Notes
If your domain logic never modifies a snapshot after it's written, you can make PositionSnapshot an immutable value object.

You can also split Position into a richer type (e.g., CashPosition, SecurityPosition) if needed.

In a real trading system, you’d model events and potentially capture snapshot as a projection of events too.

Would you like to go into:

Event sourcing style snapshots?

Adding PnL calculation into positions?

Or turning this into a hexagonal architecture / DDD module?
