I would like to install wsl Ubuntu on my windows server 2019 . I have downloaded the .appx file, how to proceed

To install WSL Ubuntu on Windows Server 2019 using a downloaded .appx file, follow these steps:

‚úÖ Prerequisites
Windows Server 2019 must be updated to at least build 16215 or later.

WSL is only supported via WSL 1 on Windows Server 2019. WSL 2 is not available on this OS.

You must have admin rights.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Installation
1. Enable WSL Feature
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
Then restart your computer.

2. Install the .appx (Ubuntu) File
Let‚Äôs say your .appx file is called Ubuntu.appx and is in C:\Installers.

Run this in PowerShell as Administrator:

Add-AppxPackage -Path "C:\Installers\Ubuntu.appx"
If you get a .appxbundle instead, use the same command with the appropriate path.

üîé If this gives a digital signature error, try installing via PowerShell using Add-AppxPackage after enabling developer mode:

reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense" /d "1"
3. Launch Ubuntu
After installation, search for "Ubuntu" in the Start Menu or run:

ubuntu
The first time it runs, it will take a few minutes to set up and ask you to create a Linux username and password.

4. (Optional) Set Default WSL Version to 1
WSL 2 is not available on Windows Server 2019, so you should explicitly use WSL 1:

wsl --set-version Ubuntu 1
Or list installed distros:

wsl --list --verbose
üí° Troubleshooting
If Add-AppxPackage fails:

You can try using PowerShell to rename .appx to .zip, extract it manually, and run the executable inside (usually named ubuntu.exe).

Example:

Rename-Item "C:\Installers\Ubuntu.appx" "C:\Installers\Ubuntu.zip"
Expand-Archive "C:\Installers\Ubuntu.zip" "C:\Installers\Ubuntu"
cd "C:\Installers\Ubuntu"
.\ubuntu.exe
This also works without installing via the Microsoft Store.

Let me know what step you're at or if you hit an error
